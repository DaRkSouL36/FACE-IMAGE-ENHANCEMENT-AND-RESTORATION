    "### OBJECTIVE\n",
    "TO ESTABLISH A ROBUST DEEP LEARNING ENVIRONMENT CAPABLE OF EXECUTING COMPLEX IMAGE RESTORATION TASKS. WE WILL LEVERAGE PYTORCH FOR TENSOR OPERATIONS AND SPECIALIZED LIBRARIES (`GFPGAN`, `REALESRGAN`) THAT IMPLEMENT GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GANS) FOR BLIND FACE RESTORATION.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DEPENDENCY ARCHITECTURE\n",
    "* **TORCH & TORCHVISION**: FOUNDATIONAL LIBRARIES FOR DEEP LEARNING AND TENSOR CALCULATIONS.\n",
    "* **OPENCV-PYTHON (CV2)**: FOR EFFICIENT IMAGE I/O AND PRE-PROCESSING MATRICES.\n",
    "* **BASISCR**: A TOOLBOX FOR IMAGE SUPER-RESOLUTION AND RESTORATION (ARCHITECTURAL BACKBONE).\n",
    "* **GFPGAN**: STATE-OF-THE-ART BLIND FACE RESTORATION MODEL LEVERAGING GENERATIVE FACIAL PRIORS.\n",
    "* **REALESRGAN**: PRACTICAL ALGORITHMS FOR GENERAL IMAGE RESTORATION.\n",
    "* **NUMPY**: FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY OBJECTS.\n",
    "* **MATPLOTLIB**: FOR VISUALIZING SIGNAL OUTPUTS AND IMAGE DATA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### INSTRUCTION FOR VS CODE USERS\n",
    "EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR TERMINAL OR A CODE CELL TO INSTALL THE NECESSARY PACKAGES. ENSURE YOUR CUDA DRIVERS ARE UPDATED IF USING GPU ACCELERATION."
