## 🧩 MODEL STACK OVERVIEW

| STAGE | MODEL | PURPOSE |
|-----|------|--------|
| FACE DETECTION | LANDMARK-BASED DETECTOR | LOCALIZATION & ALIGNMENT |
| DENOISING | CNN-BASED FILTER | NOISE & BLUR REMOVAL |
| FACE RESTORATION | GFPGAN | SEMANTIC DETAIL RECOVERY |
| SUPER-RESOLUTION | REAL-ESRGAN | SPATIAL UPSCALING |
| IDENTITY CHECK | FACE EMBEDDING MODEL | CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION |

---

## 🔬 GFPGAN — FACE RESTORATION

### ROLE
- RESTORES FACIAL DETAILS FROM DEGRADED INPUTS
- LEVERAGES GENERATIVE FACIAL PRIORS

### KEY FEATURES
- BLIND FACE RESTORATION
- SEMANTIC-AWARE DETAIL ENHANCEMENT
- ARTIFACT CONTROL

### CONFIGURATION STRATEGY
- MODERATE RESTORATION STRENGTH
- AVOID OVER-SHARPENING
- PRESERVE FACIAL GEOMETRY

---

## 🔍 REAL-ESRGAN — SUPER RESOLUTION

### ROLE
- UPSCALES IMAGE BY INTEGER FACTORS (×2, ×4)
- MAINTAINS NATURAL TEXTURE

### KEY FEATURES
- REAL-WORLD IMAGE GENERALIZATION
- ROBUST TO NOISE AND ARTIFACTS

---

## 🧠 IDENTITY VERIFICATION MODEL

### ROLE
- COMPUTES FACE EMBEDDINGS
- MEASURES COSINE SIMILARITY BETWEEN STAGES

### FAILURE CONDITIONS
- SIMILARITY BELOW THRESHOLD
- FLAGGED FOR MANUAL REVIEW OR ROLLBACK

---

## ⚖️ MODEL INTERACTION RULES

✔ RESTORATION BEFORE UPSCALING  
✔ NO MODEL OVERRIDES IDENTITY CONSTRAINTS  
✔ ALL MODELS RUN IN EVAL MODE  
✔ NO GRADIENT COMPUTATION  

---

## 🏁 SUMMARY

THIS MODEL STACK PRIORITIZES:
- REALISM OVER AGGRESSIVENESS
- IDENTITY OVER SHARPNESS
- MODULARITY OVER MONOLITHIC DESIGN

BUILT FOR PRODUCTION, RESEARCH, AND FORENSIC USE CASES.
